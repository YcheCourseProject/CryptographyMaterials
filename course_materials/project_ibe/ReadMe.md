#Course Project - Identity-Based Encryption   
##What is the project?   

The project is to study the so-called "Identity-Based Encryption" and submit a project report.

##What should I do in this project?     
- Step 1: Download the following paper about identity-based encryption J. Baek et al., A survey of identity-based cryptography
You may search the Internet and download more materials on IBE.  

- Step 2: Read IBE carefully. You should focus on Cocks' IBE algorithm, and may not read other IBE encryption systems
if you do not have the necessary background in mathematics.

- Step 3: Compare certificate-based public-key encryption with identity based encryption, and address the following questions
in your project report:

- Questions

Q1: What is the motivation for proposing the identity-based encryption?

Q2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the IBE over the traditional certificate-based public-key encryption?

Q3: Can an IBE system be used for signing digital documents? If yes, can the digital signature be used for nonrepudiation?

Q4: Do you think IBE will be widely used? Please justify your conclusion.   

##What are the format and length of my project report?  

There is no length requirement. You are suggested to write a two-page or three-page report only addressing the four questions above.   

##What is the deadline for submitting the project report?
A hardcopy of your project report must be hand in to the Instructor right before the last lecture of this course.
