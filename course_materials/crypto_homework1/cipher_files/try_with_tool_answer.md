> a legacy of atmospheric atomic bomb testing is present in an unli~ely place: people's teeth. according to a report
published today in the ~ournal nature, bomb-generated carbon isotopes trapped in toothenamel may provide a more precise
method for determining a deceased individual's age than other forensic methodscan.

> the above ground nuclear tests that occurred between 1955 and 1963
dramatically increased the amount of the isotope carbon 14
in the atmosphere. the levels rapidly e~uali~ed around the globe,
 even though the e~plosions occurred at onlyafew locations, and
entered plants in the food chain through photosynthesis. by eating plants, and animals that feed on plants,
humans absorb carbon 14 ande~hibit levels of the benign, traceable isotope that are similar to
atmospheric concentrations. what is more, carbon 14 decays with a half-lifeof 5,730 years,
aphenomenon thatscientists cane~ploit as away to determine the ages of ob~ects that
contain the isotope. forthenew study, ~onasfrisen of the medical nobel institute instoc~holm,
sweden, and his colleagues analy~edthecarbon contentoftoothenamel.
 because teeth donote~hibitany turn over during aperson's life, the scientists can determine when
 at ooth formed by comparing its carbon 14 content to past atmospheric levels.
  in addition, adult teeth form during a distinct period of childhood development around age 12, so this information
   can be translated into the age of an individual.
