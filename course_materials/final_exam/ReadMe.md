#Final-Exam
##Suggestions
- It will be semi open-book in the sense that you are allowed to bring a
hard copy of all my slides, but no other documents. You must bring a
hardcopy of my slides, as some questions refer to specific pages in my
slides.

- The final exam will cover all topics, but the focus will be on the
contents of Lectures 9 through 25 (excluding the two lectures skipped,
i.e., secret sharing and LKEv2).

- No makeup is possible without the approval from the School of Engineering.

- Mobile phones and lap tops must be turned off, if you bring them to the
classroom.

- You should get familiar with the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
I did introduce it briefly during my lecture.
